# Genetic-and-Simiulated
This project is done by CNF algorithms

In this project, the goal is to solve a logical expression in CNF form. In fact, 429 statements are given, all of which must be correct. These logical expressions must be defined in the form of 
100 variables that take the value of zero and one.
Each entry contains 100 zeros and ones.
At first, we read the logical expression and save it as a presentation. The array is twodimensional and has 429 members and each member is three.
The program works by receiving an input:
[1]: genetics
[2]: simulated
Enter your choice:
We enter the number 1 or 2 and then the corresponding algorithms are executed. If a wrong 
input is given to the program, the following statement will be displayed:
Please enter 1 or 2
The two functions that are used in both common algorithms are:
• init_state
• count_incorrect_caluses
The first function is used to create a random input. For example, it creates an array of 100.
The second function checks how many of the 429 statements with one input are not correct. 
And finally, each score
The solution is calculated as the difference between 429 and the number reported by this function.

Full description is available at the Report file.
